# Custom Git Commands
Some custom git bash aliases and functions I personally use.

## How to add
- Find your `aliases.sh` file (normally under `C:\Program Files\Git\etc\profile.d\`)
- Add the content of this projects `aliases.sh` to your existing file
- Find your `git-completion.bash` file (normally under `C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\share\git\completion\`)
- Add the content of this projects `git-completion.bash` to your existing file
- Restart Git Bash
- type `ghelp`, to show all available commands!


## Other notes
- I added the `cls` command from windows cmd as well (clears console)
